#Hanoi Towers

Simple game using HTML Drag & Drop feature.
This really simplified the game, we only had to make sure the drag/drop were allowed according to the game itself: you cannot place a larger disk over a smaller one, you can only take to top disk, you win by placing in the left pole all of the disk in the proper order.
